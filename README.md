# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final

## General Information

This project is the final assignment for the ENVS 193DS course at UCSB. The assignment covers four major problems: research writing, sea surface temperature visualization, statistical modeling of Swift Parrot nest box occupancy, and a comparison of affective and exploratory visualizations.
The work demonstrates skills in statistical communication, data cleaning and wrangling, model fitting, data visualization, and thoughtful reflection on visual design.
